title: Milestone 100k invested in stock market
subtitle: March 9 2019
---

I've heard people throw out the 100k number a significant number to have invested, a number where the investments can really start to take on a life of their own.  At this number a 10% growth in the stock market results in 10k gains.  At this the point the ball really starts rolling and your investments can add up quick.

Earlier this year we passed 100k invested in the stock market. We dipped below that this week as the Markets went on a 5 day losing streak.  But the latest round of contributions put us back over.  We have 64k invested in tax free accounts!! (Roth IRA, HSA)

**Break Down**

401K: <span style="color:green;">$36,287</span>
Roth IRA: <span style="color:green;">$44,745</span>
HSA: <span style="color:green;">$19,260</span>

Total:<span style="color:green;">$100,292</span>
