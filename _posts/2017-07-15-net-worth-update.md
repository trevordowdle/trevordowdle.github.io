title: June 2017 Net Worth Update
---

## Net Worth <span style="color:green;">**$301,051**</span>

##### Up $6,692 from [last month](/2017-06-15-net-worth-update/){:target="_blank"}

Not too much new to report this month, however we keep chugging along.  My goal is to obtain 2 million dollars in invested assets.  An annual 4% return on two million would equate to $80,000 dollars and would give me the financial freedom to pursue other goals and not be held back financially.

I'm roughly 11% of the way there.  A long way to go but with compounding on my side I'm looking forward to increased momentum along the way.
